Funny thing about this assignment is that I still can't figure out the best solution
and get fail on timing performance tests, yet, I have two implementations (2 branches) 
and both of them got exactly 96.34% on Coursera autograder.
Hope I will find better solution soon, until that time, let it just be here.
